== TextToPpt

Imports a tab-indented text file into a PowerPoint 201x pptx file.
Each tab indent will mean an indentation level (up to 4).

=== Usage

Assuming you have ~/lib for your jars and have done _mvn package_ and run _inst_

java -jar ~/lib/textToPpt.jar *.txt

=== Sample input:
 
----
My Superb Slide Show
My Slide #1 Title
	Bullet #1
		SubBullet #1
		SubBullet #2
	Bullet #2
	Bullet #3
My Slide #2
	This is how it's done:
	----
	public class Foo {
		//
	}
	----
	That was a code insert.

=== BUGS/TODO

* Needs parameteriztion ("getopt" or config file): has some dependencies on my personal setup and workflow.
* Need a way to include image files.
* You can use a .potx or a .pptx (or older) for your template, but any slides in it will not be removed.
* LT Authors: Doesn't seem to work with the 2014 templates, so try the 2012 versions then Apply Style from the 2014 when opened in PPT.
