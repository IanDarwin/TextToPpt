=== Sample input:
 
----
My Slide Show
My Slide #1 Title

		SubBullet #1
		SubBullet #2
	Bullet #2
	Bullet #3
----

=== BUGS/TODO

* Needs parameteriztion ("getopt" or config file): has some dependencies on my personal setup and workflow.
* Needs to allow AsciiDoc-like "----" lines to enable/disable code insertion; however, this is complicated,
because once you start that you have to provide a lot more formatting information.
* You can use a .potx or a .pptx (or older) for your template, but any slides in it will not be removed.
